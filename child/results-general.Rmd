#### Enrichment correlates with number of modules

This is likely do at least in part to how terms being double-counted when a
single module is split in two, and possibly also to a higher probability for
false positives for modules with very few genes.

```{r module_size_trends}
ggplot(df, aes(num_modules, total_enriched, colour=factor(merge_cor))) + 
    geom_point() + geom_smooth()

```

#### GO vs. KEGG enrichment

GO and KEGG enrichment levels are positively correlated.

```{r go_vs_kegg_enrichment}
ggplot(df, aes(go_total_enriched, kegg_total_enriched)) + 
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method='lm')
```
